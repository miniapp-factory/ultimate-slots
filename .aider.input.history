+Code the following app
+```
+A slot machine with 3 columns and 3 rows, each slot contains one fruit. The fruits should be: Apple, Banana, Cherry, Orange, Lemon. Generate an vector style image for each fruit and use it to display that fruit. The fruits should be spawned by the machine at random. The user can press the spin button, which will trigger a spinning animation that moves the columns downward, spawning new fruit at the top repeatedly for 2 seconds. Once the spinning animation is over, if there are 3 of the same fruit in the center row, display a win message to the user, which they can share on their feed. The user should always be able to spin again, except while the spinning animation is in progress.
+```
+
+Update the app metadata and generate an app icon.
