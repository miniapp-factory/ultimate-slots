```
A slot machine with 3 columns and 3 rows, each slot contains one fruit. The fruits should be: Apple, Banana, Cherry, Orange, Lemon. Generate an vector style image for each fruit and use it to display that fruit. The fruits should be spawned by the machine at random. The user can press the spin button, which will trigger a spinning animation that moves the columns downward, spawning new fruit at the top repeatedly for 2 seconds. Once the spinning animation is over, if there are 3 of the same fruit in the center row, display a win message to the user, which they can share on their feed. The user should always be able to spin again, except while the spinning animation is in progress.
```

Update the app metadata and generate an app icon.

#### Update the app metadata and generate an app icon.  

The following files are the ones that will need to be edited or added in order to implement the slot‑machine app, update the metadata, and generate the app icon:

```
mini-app/app/page.tsx
mini-app/lib/metadata.ts
mini-app/public/icon.png.todo
mini-app/components/slot-machine.tsx
mini-app/components/fruit-icons/apple.png.todo
mini-app/components/fruit-icons/banana.png.todo
mini-app/components/fruit-icons/cherry.png.todo
mini-app/components/fruit-icons/orange.png.todo
mini-app/components/fruit-icons/lemon.png.todo
```

Please add these files to the chat so I can provide the exact *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.

I need to add a few new files to implement the slot‑machine UI and the icon.  
Please add the following files to the chat so I can provide the exact *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:

```
mini-app/public/icon.png.todo
mini-app/components/slot-machine.tsx
mini-app/components/fruit-icons/apple.png.todo
mini-app/components/fruit-icons/banana.png.todo
mini-app/components/fruit-icons/cherry.png.todo
mini-app/components/fruit-icons/orange.png.todo
mini-app/components/fruit-icons/lemon.png.todo
```

Once those files are added, I’ll supply the changes for `mini-app/lib/metadata.ts` and `mini-app/app/page.tsx`.
